<h2>Running WinBinder applications</h2>
<h1>Associating the PHPW extension with WinBinder</h1>
<p>To run WinBinder scripts for Windows Explorer you have to associate .phpw files with php-win.exe.
You can accomplish this in several ways.</p>
<p><b>Option 1: automatic installation</b></p>
<p>If you use the WinBinder installer (available at the web site), this will be done automatically
for you. To run a WinBinder script, just double-click the respective .phpw file.</p>
<p><b>Option 2: manual association</b></p>
<p>To manually associate the .phpw extension to php-win.exe, follow the steps 
outlined in the Windows Help under the topic &quot;associating extensions with 
file types&quot;. Be sure to create an action named <i>open</i> and associate 
it with php-win.exe followed by&nbsp;<i>&quot;%1&quot;</i>
(with quotes). Example: <i>C:\WinBinder\PHP\PHP4\php-win.exe &quot;%1&quot;. 
</i>Alternatively, in Windows 2000
or Windows XP you can right-click or the .phpw file and select &quot;Open With...&quot; 
to perform the same action. Now you may execute a
PHPW script just by double-clicking it.</p>
<p><b>Option 3: Windows Registry</b></p>
<p>You may also add entries in the Windows registry. This procedure, however, 
is recommended for advanced users only and is beyond the scope of this documentation.</p>
<h1>Running WinBinder without a console window</h1>
<p>The console (DOS) window is quite useful to display debug information while 
you are developing an application. For distribution or for regular use, however,&nbsp;you 
may prefer to disable it. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Use php-win.exe instead of php.exe.</li>
    <li>Optionally associate .phpw files with php-win.exe (see above).</li>
    <li>Suppress all your output: remove all occurrences of <b>echo()</b>, <b>print()</b>, <b>printf()</b>,
    <b>print_r()</b>&nbsp;and other such functions from your scripts. If you do not do that, your script
    may not run at all. You may include an early call to&nbsp;<b>ob_start()</b> 
    instead as a handy way of suppressing all output.</li>
    <li>Suppress errors: use <i>error_reporting = 0</i>&nbsp;in PHP.INI. If
    you do not do that, your script may not run at all with php-win.exe.</li>
    <li>Optionally use <i>display_errors = Off</i>&nbsp;in PHP.INI. If you set
    <i>error_reporting = 0</i> this is not necessary.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Running scripts from your favorite code editor</h1>
<p>In addition to using your favorite code editor to edit WinBinder scripts, 
you may want to use it to run them. The descriptions below apply to two widely 
used text editors, but the procedure should be similar to most others. Consult 
your editor documentation for details.</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>The first step is to create a new setting for running PHP scripts. In 
    <a href="http://www.textpad.com/" target="_blank"><b>TextPad</b></a>, you 
    must open the Configure / Preferences / Tools and add a new Program. In 
    <a href="http://www.pspad.com/en/" target="_blank"><b>PSPad</b></a>, you 
    must create a new project, save it, and go to Projects / Project Settings 
    / Compiler.</li>
    <li>The new setting&nbsp;must contain the complete path to php.exe (or php-win.exe 
    if you do not want a console).&nbsp;For example, <i>C:\WinBinder\PHP\PHP4\php.exe</i>.</li>
    <li>You must also include the script name as a parameter. It is the <i>$FileName</i>&nbsp;variable 
    in <b>TextPad</b> and <i>%File%</i> in <b>PSPad</b>. Consult the editor 
    documentation if you have a different editor. Also be sure to include the 
    file path (<i>$Filedir</i> and <i>%Dir%</i> respectively).</li>
    <li>Now assign a keyboard shortcut to the newly created tool. <b>PSPad</b> 
    assigns Ctrl+F9 automatically, but you may change the shortcut to your liking 
    in Settings / Program Settings / Key Map / File / Compile. In <b>TextPad</b>, 
    go to Preferences / Keyboard / Tools category, click the command you have 
    just created, then enter the key combination you want in the shortcut edit 
    field. Now you can run a PHP script simply by pressing the shortcut.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Syntax highlighting</h1>
<p>To syntax highlight the PHP files and include the WinBinder function names 
and other keywords:</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>In <b>TextPad</b>, copy the file tools\textpad\php_winbinder.syn from 
    the WinBinder installation directory to C:\Program Files\TextPad\Samples. 
    In <b>PSPad</b>, copy the file tools\pspad\winbinder.ini from the WinBinder 
    installation directory to C:\Program Files\PSPad\Syntax.</li>
    <li>In <b>TextPad</b>, go to Configure / Preferences / Document Classes 
    / PHP, add the .phpw extension to the list,&nbsp;select Syntax in the tree 
    view and set the syntax definition file to php_winbinder.syn. In PSPad, 
    go to&nbsp;Settings / Highlighters Settings, add a new User Highlighter 
    called WinBinder and assign the .phpw extension to it. In <b>PSPad</b>, 
    go to&nbsp;Settings / Highlighters Settings, add a new User Highlighter 
    called WinBinder and assign the .phpw extension to it.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Showing help for PHP and WinBinder words from within your&nbsp;text editor</h1>
<p>You may also want to show help for PHP and WinBinder keywords and other reserved 
words directly from within your&nbsp;text editor.</p>
<ol type="1">
    <li>In <b>PSPad</b>, go to Settings / Highlighters Settings / PHP and type 
    the full path to the PHP manual (e.g. <i>C:\PHP\php_manual_en.chm</i>). 
    The hotkey Alt+F1 will call the PHP help. In <b>TextPad</b>, go to Configure 
    / Preferences / Tools / and add a new Online Help File for&nbsp;php_manual_en.chm.</li>
    <li>To add support for WinBinder keywords in <b>PSPad</b>, configure an 
    external application in the Project Settings dialog: <i>hh C:\WinBinder\docs\winbinder.chm::manual/functions/%Word%.html</i>. 
    Now you can position the text cursor over a WinBinder function and press 
    F9 for instant help. In <b>TextPad</b>, go to Configure / Preferences / 
    Tools / and add a new Online Help File to winbinder.chm.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Creating executables</h1>
<p>Please go to the <a href="http://www.hypervisual.com/winbinder/forum/" target="_blank">WinBinder 
Forum</a> for information on how to transform a WinBinder program into an executable 
(.exe).</p>
