Q1: How to get a more modern look and feel, instead of the default Windows XP style?
A1: You need a manifest file. You can either ...
  - ... create a manifest file next to your php.exe, called php.exe.manifest (see Q&A #2 for getting a manifest file)
  - ... add the manifest file directly to php.exe (see Q&A #2 and Q&A #3 for getting and adding a manifest file)

Q2: Where to get a manifest file?
A2: A ready-to-use template is available in the root folder of this repository, called 'php.exe.manifest'

Q3: When I do not want to have the manifest file next to my php.exe, can I add it somehow to php.exe directly?
A3: Yes, you can do so with the free program "Resource Hacker", or other similar software
  1. For Resource Hacker, open your php.exe in Resource Hacker
  2. Select Action > Add a new resource from the menu
  3. Select the manifest file you want to add to php.exe
  4. Set the Resource Type to 24, Resource Name to 1 and Resource Language to 1033
  5. Save php.exe
  6. Restart your WinBinder App to see the results
